# Volumetric Image Segmentation for Visualization and Analysis

VISVA is the software artifact from my interactive segmentation study. Given a 3D image, it is possible to visualize the volume slices in the three axes. With the insertion of labeled markers and the execution of the algorithm, one or multiple objects are segmented and rendered in the lower right corner. It is also possible to smooth the label image without the generation of disconnected components from the user's markers.
