# Ponto de Largada

Ponto de Largada (Starting Point, in english), was developed with a team of four people (a software engineer (me), a designer, a personal trainer and a QA). Its objective is to recommend personalised running exercises based on the runner's physical condition (i.e. height, weight, age, family history, etc.).

We built a full fledged backend along side all the necessary auxiliary tools to keep the platform running.

Ponto de Largada is online since July 2012 and thousands users are already registered.

The tech stack was: PHP, CodeIgniter, SQL, Javascript, Python
