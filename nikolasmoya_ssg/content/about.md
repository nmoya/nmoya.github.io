# Nikolas Moya


![Nikolas Moya](IcelandSmall.png "Nikolas Moya, 2019")

I'm a computer scientist with a strong foundation in software engineering and a background in computer vision. I hold a master's degree from the University of Campinas (Unicamp), where I focused on [image segmentation using graph-based methods](MoyaN-Dissertation.pdf), and contributed to [research](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10404-1_86) published at MICCAI 2014.

Over the years, I’ve worked across a variety of environments—from large enterprises to fast-paced startups—gaining full-stack development experience and learning what it takes to build software that scales. Since 2015, I’ve been part of international teams, developing digital products in collaboration with designers, managers, developers, and QA professionals. My journey has taken me from Brazil to the Netherlands, and I currently work at Accenture, where I continue to lead and contribute to product development initiatives.
