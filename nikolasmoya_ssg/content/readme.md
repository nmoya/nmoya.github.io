## About this project

This is a fun project that simulates a filesystem right in your browser. Every page behaves like a file you can navigate through. You can use keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation, or interact with the interface using your mouse just like any other website. The experience is designed to encourage exploration — a great place to start is the [**about** page](/about).


## Shortcuts

- Use **left** or **right arrows** *or* `shift+h` / `shift+l` to switch between the file browser and the file viewer.

- Whether you're in the file browser or viewing file content, use **up** or **down arrows** *or* `j` / `k` to navigate:
  - Scroll through the file content when viewing a file.
  - Move through files in the file browser.

- Press **enter** to open the currently selected file.

- You can also press **esc**, then type a command starting with a semicolon (`;`). See [## Commands](#commands) for available commands.

- Use `shift+t` or **enter** (while holding `shift`) to open the file in a new tab.

- Press **tab** to switch to the next tab.

- Use `shift+q` to close the current tab.

## Commands

- `:help` — show this page.

- `:q` — exit the website.
